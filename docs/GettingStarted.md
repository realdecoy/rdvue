# RDVue [![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/rdvue.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/rdvue)

[RDVue](https://github.com/realdecoy/rdvue) is an opinionated CLI for generating Vue.js projects. We do so by adopting
a development style guide which enforces strong typing with TypeScript, standardized Component, Layout and Page models,
and a data-layer design promoting unified consumption through Stores and Services.

## Validate Installation

We can confirm the successful installation of RDvue in three simple steps:

### Step 1: Create a project

```
npx rdvue generate project <project_name>
```

Replace `<project_name>` with the actual name of your project.

Generated folders are named in kebab-case.

### Step 2: Install project dependencies

```
cd <project_name>
npm install
```

### Step 3: Serve project

```
npm run serve
```

The project will be served at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) by default. This information will also be printed out in your terminal. Visiting the link the app is served on will display a default page which was created on project creation.
