Unit Tests with Jest
--------------------------------------

### Introduction

Unit tests are focused on validating small bits of functionality in a software product. Unit tests can be done manually or they can be automated. If you wish to learn more about unit testing and approaches that can be taken, please see here [Unit Testing](https://realdecoy.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/QPA/pages/732364878/Unit+Testing)

If you wish to automate your unit tests, [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) can be used. Jest is a JavaScript testing framework that can be integrated into several different JavaScript frameworks and it is very useful for certain use cases.

### Technical

Each component generated by the RDVue CLI comes with a <component-name>.spec.js file and the folder structure will look like the following:

The spec file generated will contain the following basic test by default:

This file is using the expect assertion library that comes with Jest and also the shallowMount method that is available to us through the ‘@vue/test-utils' library. Jest comes pre-packaged with Mocha which is enables us to use the 'describe/it’ setup to describe our test suite and our specific test case respectively.

shallowMount is used to mock or simulate what would happen to the component if it was actually mounted to the DOM. The .exists() method is used with shallowMount in order to check that the component was actually mounted and it does exist in the DOM.
